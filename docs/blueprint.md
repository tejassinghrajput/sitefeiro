- Use subtle animations via Framer Motion and Tailwind transitions for page load, scroll reveals, and hover states to enhance user engagement.
- Maintain a modular, component-based layout (Navbar, Footer, Cards, Buttons) for reusable UI elements and scalable design.
- Ensure a fully responsive design across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices for optimal user experience on any device.
