              <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-muted-foreground">
                Hello, I'm the founder of BuildNGo. With a background in Computer Science and years of professional experience building complex applications with PHP, React, and Node.js, I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly of the web development industry.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
                Too often, I saw talented entrepreneurs and small businesses with brilliant ideas held back by the same frustrating hurdles: web development that was painfully slow, prohibitively expensive, and needlessly complicated. The traditional agency model felt broken, designed for large corporations, not for the agile and ambitious.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
                BuildNGo is my answer to that problem. I created it to be everything I wished for as a client: a service that is incredibly fast, transparently priced, and relentlessly focused on quality. By leveraging a modern, standardized tech stack and a streamlined process, we eliminate the bottlenecks and deliver exceptional websites in a fraction of the time. Our goal isn't just to build sites; it's to empower you to make your mark on the world.
