You've built a beautiful website, but how do customers find it? The answer is **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**.

### What is SEO?

SEO is the process of improving your website to increase its visibility when people search for products or services related to your business in Google, Bing, and other search engines. The better visibility your pages have in search results, the more likely you are to garner attention and attract prospective and existing customers to your business.

### Why is SEO Important?

1.  **Organic Traffic is High-Quality Traffic:** People searching on Google have a specific need. If your website appears in the results, you're providing a solution right when they need it. This traffic is more likely to convert than traffic from other sources.
2.  **It Builds Trust and Credibility:** Ranking high on Google is a stamp of approval. It tells users that your site is a trusted source of information or a reputable business.
3.  **It's a Long-Term Strategy:** Unlike paid ads, the effects of good SEO are long-lasting. A well-optimized page can bring in traffic for years.
4.  **It Provides Actionable Data:** SEO provides a wealth of data about your customers, including what they search for, how they browse, and what they're interested in. You can use this data to make better business decisions.

### Basic Pillars of SEO

-   **On-Page SEO:** Optimizing individual web pages to rank higher. This includes using relevant keywords in your titles, headings, and content.
-   **Off-Page SEO:** Actions taken outside of your own website to impact your rankings, such as building backlinks from other reputable sites.
-   **Technical SEO:** Improving the technical aspects of a website to help search engine spiders crawl and index your site more effectively. This includes things like site speed, mobile-friendliness, and having a secure site (HTTPS).
